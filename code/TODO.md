

i want a virtual desktop/OS/terminal system that I can use for a game
similar to WTTG

- filesystem
- terminal
    - can interact with filesystem - cd pwd mkdir rm cp mv cat
    - can run designated programs - maybe some hacker tool
- way to run processes
- windows/desktop
    - we dont just want a terminal screen, that'd be boring
    - browser application? i have no clue how to do that
- hacker minigames like WTTG

- terminal colors :)
- terminal env vars
- terminal cd relative path / absolute path

lets just start with a terminal


- figure out how to have no windows in focus



i want it to be a terminal based game
using stuff like ssh-ing into a machine
and trying to learn information
- ssh <username>@<machine_IP>
- exit - exit a terminal/machine
- prompt - <username>@<machine_name>:<cwd>> 
- maybe some way to gain access to other computers desktop
- maybe code in some event where you have to fight for control over mouse with another person? idk
- privalege escalation
- maybe some mission based thing where you need to delete their files? or need to get some info
- or maybe need to determine if they are good or bad?

maybe some money system?
- crypto?
- some way to earn money
- something to spend money on

OS
- name: CeruleanOS 
- Cerulean color #2A52BE
- Lock screen
- task bar
- moveable/resizeable windows
- filesystem
- 

a way to save to a file so you can return to the machine/game again later

- terminal needs to handle more than just command input
    - ssh will prompt for password:


window display order
- linked-list
    - gets around the problems of a z-index
    - clicking on a window pops it from the linked list and pushes to the tail
    - we can store a node reference to the clickable window for fast lookup
    - also, i get to make a linked-list
    - idk if overkill - maybe?
    - but should be fast? idk alternative

internet mechanism
- maybe if you stay on a network too long, the police find you? like wttg2?
- or maybe occasionally, hackers will hit you offline and you have to switch wifi's - loosely like dead signal

generic window
- minimize
- maximize
- exit button
- title bar - draggable
- main content pane
- resizeable
- keyboard input is only used if window is focused
    - clicking window focuses it
    - clicking off of window removes focus

Apps
- terminal
- file explorer
- calculator? - why not? immersion
- browser? - super simple browser
    - darkweb? idk
- messenger app
- VPN
- hacker store
- paint?

Widgets
- location services - so you know when people are trying to find you - wttg1
- wifi/internet status
- battery?
- sound?
- settings 
    - cheaky game settings
    - maybe add desktop customization for fun? immersion?
        - we may actually want this if the game has the user sshing into other machines
        - so customization + variety
- money/crypto


maybe we can encorporate programming in some way?
super simple programming langauge that the user can use?
idk what for though but would be fun to code a compiler and interpreter :)
and impressive
we're going for impressive
but also need a playable game
- a bash like langauge but useable :P



https://squaremyimage.com/
- to convert rect to square icons

maybe add in a geoguessr element?
- suspect's computer could have images on it
- and you have to look through them
- to determine what country they are in?

- sign into someones computer and find out which country? by timezone?
- widgets come into play

location services widget
- only shows when something is requesting your location
- so a widget that is there sometimes and removed others

additional widgets
- 


right click for popup options

- make a really challenging multi-tasker mode
